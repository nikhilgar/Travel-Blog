1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,380
Hello, I'm super excited to start this course with you, but as always, before we do, we need to

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:13,260
see where we're starting and where we're ending up so we have a clear path to succeeding.

3
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,870
So let's see what this course will look like for you.

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,010
Were first going to start off with creating our hacking lab.

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,830
Now, don't worry whether you're on Windows, Mac or Linux, you're going to be able to follow because

6
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:33,090
what we'll do is use something called a virtual machine to install CALEIGH Linux, which is often used

7
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:39,700
with ethical hacking onto our machine so that we can simulate and create our hacking environment.

8
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,760
Don't worry, all the tools we're going to use is free and you're going to be able to set up your computer

9
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,310
in a way to follow the rest of the course.

10
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,300
And you're also going to have a professional setup.

11
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,750
We're also going to cover some basics on hacking, some fundamentals and principles that's going to

12
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,390
set us up for success later on in the course.

13
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:05,430
Then we have an optional part for those that really want to get into programming as well and possibly

14
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:11,430
programming some of our projects later on in the course, we're going to teach you Python from scratch

15
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:19,290
or if you know Python already as a refresher so that you can also learn an extra pair of skill set for

16
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,450
some harder projects that we have in the course.

17
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:27,690
Then we get into the fun part and the first step we're going to dive into after we have our hacking

18
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,760
lab and some of our programming skills.

19
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,890
Sharp is reconnaissance.

20
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:38,280
Here is where we learn what we call footprinting, or in other words, information gathering once we

21
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,250
choose our target.

22
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,910
Our first task is to gain as much information about the target as possible.

23
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:50,310
We're going to talk about IP addresses, about the Who is Tooele, the Web Stiltskin, finding usernames,

24
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:57,110
building an email scraper tool and other tools available to us to gather as much information as possible.

25
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,140
From there we go into Skåne and this is where things get real.

26
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:06,720
In this section, we gather information on some of the technical information that we can acquire from

27
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,170
a target.

28
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,180
For example, if they have open ports, if they have a firewall, what software they're running on these

29
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,390
ports and if they have any outdated operating systems.

30
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,370
And don't worry, if you don't know what any of this means, we take you from scratch and you're going

31
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,020
to learn it all.

32
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:28,320
Here is where we learn about TCP UDP using the powerful and map tool, different types of scans that

33
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,580
we can do, how to work with firewalls, using decoys and packet fragmentation.

34
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,930
And we're also going to build a port scanner project in the section.

35
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,830
From there we go into vulnerability analysis.

36
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:46,410
In this section we use the information that we gathered from the previous sections and with this information

37
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:52,350
that we tried to determine whether there is a known vulnerability that we can take advantage of.

38
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:58,200
We're going to use different sorts of tools to learn about our target system and where their weaknesses

39
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,440
are.

40
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,020
We're actually going to work on a Windows seven machine that has a vulnerability and show how we can

41
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,010
break into it and how we can use that to our advantage then.

42
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,320
Well, this is the exciting part.

43
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,360
This is the big part of the course.

44
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,530
This is where we attack and gain access to the target machines.

45
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:21,360
And throughout this session, we'll be covering many different vulnerabilities and different targets.

46
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:27,840
We perform different sorts of attacks on virtual machines and cover a very important tool of an ethical

47
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,230
hacker.

48
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,480
That is that Métis point framework.

49
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,650
The goal of exploitation is to get on a target machine.

50
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,690
So this means we must drop a payload on that target machine so we can use it to navigate through their

51
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:45,270
systems, look through their files, execute anything we want, even delete anything we want without

52
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,840
the target.

53
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,280
Knowing anything about it.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,310
We'll learn to create our own viruses and Trojans that we can deliver to the target, whether through

55
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,140
an email or through a USB.

56
00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:00,570
This is a big section and we're going to dive into the weeds, try out these techniques and learn how

57
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,650
to defend against them.

58
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,130
After that, we have what we call the post exploitation.

59
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,630
This, as the name suggests, is what we do after we exploit a target.

60
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,940
Since we're on that machine, we can do many things depending on what we want to get out from it at

61
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:20,430
the end after we do all the things we wanted by exploiting the target, we want to make sure we cover

62
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:26,760
our tracks by deleting any event logs or deleting any evidence that we were ever on that machine.

63
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:31,950
We're going to learn lots of things here, such as creating persistence on a target machine and even

64
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,800
creating a backdoor in one of our projects.

65
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:41,460
We then get into a very important part that a lot of you might find very, very interesting, and that

66
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,260
is website penetration testing.

67
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,020
This is a big topic for an ethical hacker.

68
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:50,970
And in this section, we're mainly targeting websites and their bugs and vulnerabilities.

69
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:58,110
These vulnerabilities can be anything from misconfiguration, askew, all injections, information disclosures,

70
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,520
command ejections.

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,490
Site scripting attacks, and we're also going to quote our own and create our own project to a login

72
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,900
brute force script and also a directory discovery tool.

73
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:13,890
Again, in this section, you're going to learn how to use these techniques and therefore defend against

74
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:17,080
them on your own website or a client's Web site.

75
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:22,040
Then we get into something that you have to know as an ethical hacker.

76
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,810
It's the man in the middle attack.

77
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,760
This is an attack that is used inside a network.

78
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:33,630
And this allows us to sniff any unencrypted data and see it in plain text so we could use this technique

79
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,970
to see passwords for some websites.

80
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:41,660
And we're going to cover some of the main tools that hackers use when doing a man in the middle attack.

81
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,060
We then have a bonus section on wi fi and wireless cracking.

82
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:52,220
This is the section where we want to gain access to a network by cracking its wireless password.

83
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:58,200
And we're going to talk about things like air crack, password cracking and cat password cracking and

84
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,950
show you how you might use this and how attackers might use this on your wireless network.

85
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,940
Now, we got lots to cover, but I also want to talk about the best bar right here, our online private

86
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,740
community of over 300000 students.

87
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,950
We have people chatting here every day helping each other out to finish the course, doing challenges

88
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:20,500
together and talking about the latest and greatest in technology.

89
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:25,980
This is an optional resource for you to use so you can have back and forth conversation with other students

90
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:26,720
and myself.

91
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:29,330
So you feel like you're part of a real classroom.

92
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,380
But you know what?

93
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,610
Enough talk.

94
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,850
I know you're getting excited.

95
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,680
I am, too.

96
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,170
So let's get started and let's learn ethical hacking.
